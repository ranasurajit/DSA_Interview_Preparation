# 487. Max Consecutive Ones II

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in the array if you can flip at most one `0`.

## Example

**Input:** `[1,0,1,1,0]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** Flip the first zero to get the maximum number of consecutive 1s. After flipping, the sequence becomes `[1,1,1,1,0]`, resulting in 4 consecutive 1s.

## Constraints

- The input array will only contain `0` and `1`.
- The length of the input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000.

## Follow-up

What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream? In other words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too large to hold in memory. Could you solve it efficiently?
